SQL best practices:

✔ Use EXISTS in place of IN wherever possible
✔ Use table aliases with columns when you are joining multiple tables
✔ Use GROUP BY instead of DISTINCT.
✔ Add useful comments wherever you write complex logic and avoid too many comments.
✔ Use joins instead of subqueries when possible for better performance.
✔ Use WHERE instead of HAVING to define filters on non-aggregate fields
✔ Avoid wildcards at beginning of predicates (something like '%abc' will cause full table scan to get the results)
✔ Considering cardinality within GROUP BY can make it faster (try to consider unique column first in group by list)
✔ Write SQL keywords in capital letters.
✔ Never use select *, always mention list of columns in select clause.
✔ Create CTEs instead of multiple sub queries , it will make your query easy to read.
✔ Join tables using JOIN keywords instead of writing join condition in where clause for better readability.
✔ Never use order by in sub queries , It will unnecessary increase runtime.
✔ If you know there are no duplicates in 2 tables, use UNION ALL instead of UNION for better performance
✔ Always start WHERE clause with 1 = 1.This has the advantage of easily commenting out conditions during debugging a query.
✔ Taking care of NULL values before using equality or comparisons operators. Applying window functions. Filtering the query before joining and having clause.
✔ Make sure the JOIN conditions among two table Join are either keys or Indexed attribute.
